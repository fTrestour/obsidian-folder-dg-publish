# Why this plugin?

I use [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) and this plugin uses a dg-publish field in the frontmatter to declare files that will be published online.
I want all files in a specific folder to be published, and didn't find a nice way to do it, so I made this plugin.

I don't publish this plugin as it seems to be a very niche need but feel free to open an issue if you'd like to use it too.
